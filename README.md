This is the repo for a keyboard I designed with Hack Club!

Features:
 - 2.4ghz / Bluetooth / Wired connectivity, with a custom dongle for 2.4Ghz!
 - Per-key RGB Lighting (Can consume 3.5A at full brightness 😭)
 - Low Profile Design (Hotswappable Kailh Choc v1/v2)
 - Reverse-Charging Devices from its own battery
 - OLED Screen to display animations / A GUI :D
 - 3A Fast Charging

Files in the REPO:
 - 3D Cad Files
 - The firmware (built on KMK) for both the keyboard and the dongle
 - The main board schematic & PCB
 - The plate (to be made out of FR4)
